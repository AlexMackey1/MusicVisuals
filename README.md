# Description of the assignment
This is our visualization of Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen. We felt that this song chnages drastcially minute to minute so
therefore it would be the best choice to do a visualization project on. Due to all of the chnages we would be able to showcase
everything that we learnt as the song transitioned between different beats, moods and speed etc.

# Instructions
Our song changes at specific intervals that we chose below.

0:00 - 0:16 Intro (mode 4)
0:16 - 1:57 Alex  (mode 0)
1:57 - 3:04 Sergei (mode 3)
3:04 - 4:09 Sergei (mode 2)
4:09 - 5:59 Aaron  (mode 1)

Apart from that you can use "p" to pause the audion and you can use the number keys above to manually chnage between the visualizations.

### How it works
# Alex
My code used the OOP principles of encapsulation and inheritance. The majority of the code is the "BoxClass" and "RotatingCircles" classes. These are then called on in "Alex" class which is my visulation. It comprises of 4 boxsets from the boxset class, that rotate at different speeds and change colours based on amplitude and frquency bands. There a

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
